### Android

Android Interview Questions and Answers:

#### Base

* **Why does an Android App lag?** - [Learn from here](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/android-app-lag)

* **What is `Context`? How is it used?** - [Context In Android Application](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/context-in-android-application)

* **Tell all the Android application components.** - [Learn from here](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals.html#Components)

* **What is the project structure of an Android Application?** - [Learn from here](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects)

* **What is `AndroidManifest.xml`?** - [Learn from here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro)

* **What is the `Application` class?**
    - The Application class in Android is the base class within an Android app that contains all other components such as activities and services. The Application class, or any subclass of the Application class, is instantiated before any other class when the process for your application/package is created.

#### Activity and Fragment

* **Why is it recommended to use only the default constructor to create a `Fragment`?** - Learn from [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CitBt0FZFIc) and [blog](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/default-constructor-to-create-a-fragment)

* **What is `Activity` and its lifecycle?** - [Learn from here](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle)

* **What is the difference between onCreate() and onStart()** - [Learn from here](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle)

* **When only onDestroy is called for an activity without onPause() and onStop()?** - [Learn from here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2kY_ckZa-g)

* **Why do we need to call setContentView() in onCreate() of Activity class?** - [Learn from here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1aHAt7XC5I)

* **What is onSaveInstanceState() and onRestoreInstanceState() in activity?**
    - onSaveInstanceState() - This method is used to store data before pausing the activity.
    - onRestoreInstanceState() - This method is used to recover the saved state of an activity when the activity is recreated after destruction. So, the onRestoreInstanceState() receives the bundle that contains the instance state information.

* **What is `Fragment` and its lifecycle?** - [Learn from here](https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments/lifecycle)

* **What are "launchMode"?** - [Learn from here](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/singletask-launchmode-in-android) and [singleTask launchMode in Android](https://youtu.be/WYkQEnm4jeI)

* **What is the difference between a `Fragment` and an `Activity`? Explain the relationship between the two.** - [Learn from here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10478233/why-fragments-and-when-to-use-fragments-instead-of-activities)

* **When should you use a Fragment rather than an Activity?**
    - When you have some UI components to be used across various activities
    - When multiple views can be displayed side by side just like ViewPager

* **What is the difference between FragmentPagerAdapter vs FragmentStatePagerAdapter?**
    - FragmentPagerAdapter: Each fragment visited by the user will be stored in the memory but the view will be destroyed. When the page is revisited, then the view will be created not the instance of the fragment.
    - FragmentStatePagerAdapter: Here, the fragment instance will be destroyed when it is not visible to the user, except the saved state of the fragment.

* **What is the difference between adding/replacing fragment in backstack?** - [Learn from here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24466302/basic-difference-between-add-and-replace-method-of-fragment/24466345)

* **How would you communicate between two Fragments?**

* **What is retained `Fragment`?**
    - By default, Fragments are destroyed and recreated along with their parent Activities when a configuration change occurs. Calling setRetainInstance(true) allows us to bypass this destroy-and-recreate cycle, signaling the system to retain the current instance of the fragment when the activity is recreated.

* **What is the purpose of `addToBackStack()` while commiting fragment transaction?**
    - By calling addToBackStack(), the replace transaction is saved to the back stack so the user can reverse the transaction and bring back the previous fragment by pressing the Back button. For more [Learn from here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22984950/what-is-the-meaning-of-addtobackstack-with-null-parameter)

#### Views and ViewGroups

* **What is `View` in Android?**

* **Can you a create custom view? How?**

* **What are ViewGroups and how they are different from the Views?**
    - View: View objects are the basic building blocks of User Interface(UI) elements in Android. View is a simple rectangle box which responds to the userâ€™s actions. Examples are EditText, Button, CheckBox etc. View refers to the android.view.View class, which is the base class of all UI classes.
    - ViewGroup: ViewGroup is the invisible container. It holds View and ViewGroup. For example, LinearLayout is the ViewGroup that contains Button(View), and other Layouts also. ViewGroup is the base class for Layouts.

* **What is a `BroadcastReceiver`?** - [Learn from here](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts)

* **What is a Sticky `Intent`?**
    - Sticky Intents allows communication between a function and a service. sendStickyBroadcast() performs a sendBroadcast(Intent) known as sticky, i.e. the Intent you are sending stays around after the broadcast is complete, so that others can quickly retrieve that data through the return value of registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter). For example, if you take an intent for ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED to get battery change events: When you call registerReceiver() for that action â€” even with a null BroadcastReceiver â€” you get the Intent that was last Broadcast for that action. Hence, you can use this to find the state of the battery without necessarily registering for all future state changes in the battery.

* **Describe how broadcasts and intents work to be able to pass messages around your app?** - [Learn from here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7276537/using-a-broadcast-intent-broadcast-receiver-to-send-messages-from-a-service-to-a)

* **What is a `PendingIntent`?**
    - If you want someone to perform any Intent operation at future point of time on behalf of you, then we will use Pending Intent.

* **What are the different types of Broadcasts?** - [Learn from here](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts)

#### Services

* **What is the difference between Serializable and Parcelable? Which is the best approach in Android?** 
    - Use the Parcelable class instead of Serializable when passing data in Intents or Bundles. The serialization of an object that implements the Parcelable interface is much faster than using Javaâ€™s default serialization. A class that implements the Serializable interface is marked as serializable, and Java serializes it using reflection (which makes it slow). When using the Parcelable interface, the whole object doesnâ€™t get serialized automatically. Rather, you can selectively add data from the object to a Parcel using which the object is later deserialized. Similarly, you can consider the Parcelable in Kotlin.

### Java

Android Interview Questions and Answers:

#### OOP

* **Explain OOP Concepts.**

* **Differences between abstract classes and interfaces?** 
    - An abstract class, is a class that contains both concrete and abstract methods 
    (methods without implementations). An abstract method must be implemented by the abstract class
     sub-classes. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and need to be extended to be used.
    - An interface is like a blueprint/contract of a class (or it may be thought of as a class with methods, but without their implementation). It contains empty methods that 
    represent, what all of its subclasses should have in common. The subclasses provide the 
    implementation for each of these methods. Interfaces are implemented.

* **Difference between method overloading and overriding.**

* **What are the access modifiers you know? What does each one do?**
   - There are four access modifiers in Java language (from strictest to the most lenient):
        1. `private` *variables*, *methods*, *constructors* or *inner classes* are only visible to its' containing class and its' methods. This modifier is most commonly used, for example, to allow variable access only through getters and setters or to hide underlying implementation of classes that should not be used by user and therefore maintain encapsulation. Singleton constructor is also marked `private` to avoid unwanted instantiation from outside.
        2. `Default` (no keyword is used) this modifier can be applied to *classes*, *variables*, *constructors* and *methods* and allows access from classes and methods inside the same package.
        3. `protected` can be used on *variables*, *methods* and *constructors* therefore allowing access only to subclasses and classes that are inside the same package as protected members' class.
        4. `public` modifier is widely-used on *classes*, *variables*, *constructors* and *methods* to grant access from any class and method anywhere. It should not be used everywhere as it implies that data marked with `public` is not sensitive and can not be used to harm the program.

* **Can an Interface implement another Interface?**
  - Yes, an interface can implement another interface (and more than one), but it needs to use `extends`, rather than `implements` keyword. And while you can not remove methods from parent interface, you can add new ones freely to your sub-interface.

* **What is Polymorphism? What about Inheritance?**

#### Objects and Primitives

* **How is `String` class implemented? Why was it made immutable?**
  - There is no primitive variant of `String` class in Java language - all strings are just wrappers around underlying array of characters, which is declared `final`. This means that, once a `String` object is instantiated, it cannot be changed through normal tools of the language (Reflection still can mess things up horribly, because in Java no object is truly immutable). This is why `String` variables in classes are the first candidates to be used, when you want to override `hashCode()` and `equals()` of your class - you can be sure, that all their required contracts will be satisfied.
    > Note: The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. The String class  has a number of methods, some of which will be discussed below, that appear to modify strings. Since strings are  immutable, what these methods really do is create and return a new string that contains the result of the operation. ([Official Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/strings.html))

    This class is also unique in a sense, that, when you create an instance like this:
    ```java
    String helloWorld = "Hello, World!";
    ```
    `"Hello, World!"` is called a *literal* and compiler creates a `String` object with its' value. So
    ```java
    String capital = "Hello, World!".toUpperCase();
    ```
    is a valid statement, that, firstly, will create an object with literal value "Hello, World!" and then will create and return another object with value "HELLO, WORLD!"
  - `String` was made immutable to prevent malicious manipulation of data, when, for example, user login or other sensitive data is being send to a server.

* **What does it means to say that a `String` is immutable?**
    - It means that once created, `String` object's `char[]` (its' containing value) is declared `final` and, therefore, it can not be changed during runtime.

* **Can you list 8 primitive types in java?**
    - `byte`
    - `short`
    - `int`
    - `long`
    - `float`
    - `double`
    - `char`
    - `boolean`

* **What is the difference between an Integer and int?**
  - `int` is a primitive data type (with `boolean`, `byte`, `char`, `short`, `long`, `float` and `double`), while `Integer` (with `Boolean`, `Byte`, `Character`, `Short`,`Long`, `Float` and `Double`) is a [wrapper](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberclasses.html) class that encapsulates primitive data type, while providing useful methods to perform different tasks with it.

* **Do objects get passed by reference or value in Java? Elaborate on that.**

#### Java Memory Model and Garbage Collector

* **What is garbage collector? How does it work?**
  - All objects are allocated on the heap area managed by the JVM.
  As long as an object is being referenced, the JVM considers it alive.
  Once an object is no longer referenced and therefore is not reachable by the application code,
  the garbage collector removes it and reclaims the unused memory.

#### Concurrency

* **What does the keyword `synchronized` mean?**

* **What is a `ThreadPoolExecutor`?** - [ThreadPoolExecutor in Android](https://amitshekhar.me/blog/threadpoolexecutor-in-android)

* **What is `volatile` modifier?**

* **The classes in the atomic package expose a common set of methods: `get`, `set,`, `lazyset`, `compareAndSet`, and `weakCompareAndSet`. Please describe them.**

#### Exceptions

* **How does the `try{}`, `catch{}`, `finally` works?**

* **What is the difference between a `Checked Exception` and an `Un-Checked Exception`?**

* **What is serialization? How do you implement it?**

* **What is `transient` modifier?**

* **What are anonymous classes?**

* **What is the difference between using `==` and `.equals` on an object?**

* **What is the `hashCode()` and `equals()` used for?**

* **When would you make an object value `final`?**

* **What are these `final`, `finally` and `finalize` keywords?**

* **What is the difference between "throw" and "throws" keyword in Java?**
    - `throws` is just used to indicated which exception is to be thrown. But the `throw` keyword is used to throw some exception from any static block or any method.

* **What does the `static` word mean in Java?**
    - In case of `static` variable it means that this variable (its' value or the object it references) spans across all instances of enclosing class (changing it in one instance affects all others), while in case of `static` methods it means that these methods can be invoked without an instance of their enclosing class. It is useful, for example, when you create util classes that need not be instantiated every time you want to use them.

* **Can a `static` method be overridden in Java?**
    - While child class can override a static method with another static method with the same signature (return type can be down-casted), it is not truly overridden - it becomes "hidden", but both methods can still be accessed under right circumstances (see question about overloading/overriding above).

* **When is a `static` block run?**
    - Code inside static block is executed only once: the first time you make an object of that class or the first time you access a static member of that class (even if you never make an object of that class).
